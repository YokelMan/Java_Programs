# Java_Programs
A repo for my Java Programs, feel free to use any part of the code, just make sure to give me credit!

This is a readme file containing a brief description of the programs included in this package.
All of the programs in this package/repository **Java_Programs**, are made by me, Vedant Jadhav and every program is based solely on my logic.

The programs in this package are listed below with their brief descriptions:
1. CaesarCipher.java (A program for encrypting and decrypting any text using caesar cipher - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/)
2. Calculator.java (A program for a calculator which takes infinite inputs)
3. Main.java (A program made for the sole purpose of executing programs which do not have main methods)
4. RandomNumberGenerator.java (A program made for generating random numbers, including both limits given)
5. VigenereCipher.java (A program for encrypting and decrypting any text using the VigenÃ¨re cipher - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vigenere-cipher/)
6. TicTacToe.java (A program for playing TicTacToe; you'll need two players cause I don't know how to create a bot to play with youðŸ˜”)
7. Anagram.java (A program to check if two words are anagrams of each other or not)
8. PlayfairCipher.java (A program for encrypting and decrypting any text using the Playfair cipher - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/playfair-cipher-with-examples/)
9. DecimalPlaces.java (A program for printing out a fraction in decimal format with a given number of decimal places)

Any other programs in this repository which are not in this list are those which are still in progress (refer to point 2 in the notes section down below).

Please note:
1. You CANNOT download any program separately and expect the program to work properly. If you wish to do so, please replace the first non-comment line - `package Java_Programs;` - in the program with the name of your own package (`package <name>;`), and either add a main method or convert the working method to a main method - replace the method declaration line with `public static void main(String[] args) {`.
2. The Casino.java program is not listed in the above list as it is currently suspended. Feel free to make any changes or suggest them on my discord, given in my profile!
